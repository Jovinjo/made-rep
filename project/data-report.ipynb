The dataset contains all necessary information required about electricity generation, emissions, and demand across multiple countries in Europe. It has consistency in its format across different variables, countries, and years. Furthermore, The data aligns with the needs of the project.

Additionally, uncertainties regarding the optimal representation of GDP ($US) values is an issue, since large numerical values may hinder readability and comprehension during analysis. Thus, further refinement of the GDP data representation, such as converting values to billion or million units, still need to be determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus on only three specific countries and the limited timeframe from 2000 to 2021 may introduce potential biases into the analysis. These biases may restrict the generalizability of conclusions. Careful interpretation is important, as the transformed dataset may not fully represent the diversity across Europe. Lastly, a thoughtful consideration and exploration on the choice of variables (e.g. Electricity Demand or Electricity Demand per Capita) is still required to ensure the robustness of analysis outcomes. \n",
