# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Analyzing the Impact of Major Carbon Emitters on Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Change (1988-2022)

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How have the emissions from major carbon producers contributed to global greenhouse gas emissions, and what are the broader implications for climate change over the period 1988-2022?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
This project aims to explore the relationship between major carbon producers (Carbon Majors) and global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and to assess the broader implications for climate change. Using the "Carbon Majors Dataset (1988-2022): Emissions Data from Fossil Fuel Producers," the study will provide a detailed analysis of emissions attributed to key carbon producers over 34 years. The dataset includes information on annual emissions from major fossil fuel companies, their production volumes, and the resulting GHG emissions. By understanding these correlations, the project seeks to inform climate policies and strategies aimed at emission reductions and climate change mitigation.

## Datasources
