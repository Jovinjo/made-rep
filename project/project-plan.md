# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Analyzing the Correlation between Major Carbon Emitter, Economic Development, and Climate Change (2000--2022)

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How have emissions from specific commodity within major carbon-producing countries contributed to their overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2000 to 2022? and what is the relationship with the economic growth of those countries?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
This project aims to investigate the contributions of specific commodities to the overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of major carbon-producing countries and explore the relationship between these emissions and the economic growth of those countries from 2000 to 2022. Using the "Carbon Majors Dataset," which includes detailed emissions data from major fossil fuel producers, the study will analyze the impact of commodity-specific emissions on national and global GHG trends. Additionally, the project will examine the correlation between these emissions and economic indicators to understand the interplay between carbon production, economic development, and climate change. The findings will provide insights into the effectiveness of current climate policies and strategies, helping to inform future efforts aimed at reducing emissions and mitigating climate change.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: Carbon Majors Dataset
* Metadata URL: https://carbonmajors.org/site//data/000/000/Carbon_Majors_README.pdf
* Data URL: https://carbonmajors.org/evoke/391/get_cm_file?type=Basic&file=emissions_high_granularity.csv
* Data Type: CSV
* Description: The Carbon Majors database aims to trace greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels and cement produced by companies, historically from as early as 1854 to 2022. For this project, we focus on the datasets for the period of 2000-2022

### Datasource2: World GDP Dataset

* Data URL: https://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?downloadformat=csv
* Data Type: CSV
* Description: Country GDP in US dollars for the period of 1960 to 2021. For this project, we focus on the datasets for the period of 2000-2022
