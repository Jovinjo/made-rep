# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Analyzing the Impact of Tree Cover Loss on Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Change (2001-2022)

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How does tree cover loss impact greenhouse gas emissions and carbon sequestration, and what are the broader implications for climate change over the period 2001-2022?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
This project aims to explore the relationship between tree cover loss and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and to assess the broader implications for climate change. Using the "Global Forest Data (2001-2022): Tree Cover, Biomass, and Carbon Flux Analysis" dataset, the study will provide a detailed analysis of global forestry metrics over 21 years. The dataset includes information on tree cover extent, aboveground biomass stocks and densities, annual records of tree cover loss, forest GHG emissions, and CO2 removals. By understanding these correlation, the project seeks to inform environmental policies and strategies aimed at forest conservation and carbon management.
